Done:
- P1 - Generate Stacked up structure of n*m
- P1 - Convert all the stacked up structure data into binary
- P1 - Create Label Structure for left matrix
- P1 - Create Label Structure for right matrix
- P1 - Generating Shards using the Encryptor
- P2 - Perform Rotation for left matrix

In progress
- P2 - Switching last rows of every right matrix in stacked structure
- P2 -  perform rotation for right matrix

To do

- M - apply recovery method to this version
- P2 - verify rotation is performed correctly

Wish list
- BNN ops
- Two-party authentication protocol

I've created 4 milestones and re-organized the project page so that everything is linked (cards-issues-milestones).

Perhaps during our next meeting I can go into more detail on what I have done. Here's some brief points:
- All tasks are created as a "Issue" in their respective milestone. Then added to the "To-Do" column under projects.
- Whoever will work on that task will claim by assigning to themselves and move it into "In-progress"
- One complete, that person will move to "Ready for Review" and assign to me, and if I am the one who moved it I will ask which of you is available to review my work
- After review and the tasks is completed successfully, move to "Done" and close the issue. This will update the progress under the milestone as well.

Milestones (can be found under Issues->Milestones):

1. X-Code (X-Cipher) foundational base:
- this regards the foundational code, all of the basic operations. 
- All of these tasks are in the "Review" section and I will move these to "Done" after reviewing one more time.

2. Enabling Multiples in X-Cipher
- everything that involves enabling recovery for multiple stacked X-Code matrices.

3. Two-party authentication and recovery protocol
- One way to map the X-Cipher to a functionality
- Data Owner (DO) and Server (S). DO has data, puts into X-Cipher structure (computes parity and encrypts), and sends to S. S has function to recompute the parity bits (MAC) from the encrypted data, and sends back to DO. DO verifies whether the data was corrupted.
- This milestone marks completion of a prototype of this protocol

4. BNN operations with data recovery
- This regards enabling BNN operations over the X-Cipher structure.
- Operations such as convolution filter
- Will need to do more background research to determine other important operations.
- Ultimate goal is to enable recovery at any point in BNN execution.
